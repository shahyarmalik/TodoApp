Todo App (Android Studio)
Technologies used: Room Database, LiveData, ViewModel, Jetpack Compose

Developed a Todo application that allows users to add tasks, view the task list, and delete tasks with a simple UI built using Jetpack Compose.
Implemented Room Database for local data storage, ensuring data persistence across app restarts, and used LiveData and ViewModel to manage UI updates in response to database changes.
Designed the app so that newly added tasks appear at the bottom of the list and can be deleted with a swipe or click.
Focused on providing a clean and intuitive user experience with seamless task management and real-time updates.
